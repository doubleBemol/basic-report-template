# basic-report-template

Basic team report written in LaTeX (Spanish encoding)

This latex template uses files.

Add your sections as files (inside this files you can have subsection etc.) , so if you need three sections you need to create 3 files, 
let say: section1.tex, section1.tex, section1.tex.
for simplicity I added a folder named sections, so you will add your section files in *sections/my_section.tex*.

To add your files to the final PDF just open up in the root the file called report.text, then go to the document section and add them
in the \input(your_file.tex). Finally, just compile your file and that's all.
